
# Database Design

## Overview

The database design follows a normalized structure to minimize redundancy and ensure data integrity. Each table represents a distinct entity in the system, with well-defined relationships between entities. Primary keys ensure uniqueness, while foreign keys enforce referential integrity.

## Tables and Relationships

### 1. CPAs Table
- **Primary Key**: `cpa_id` (SERIAL)
- **Columns**:
  - `cpa_id`: Auto-incremented unique identifier for each CPA.
  - `name` (VARCHAR(100)): The name of the CPA.
- **Purpose**:
  - This table stores information about Certified Public Accountants.
  - Used to associate CPAs with clients.

### 2. Clients Table
- **Primary Key**: `client_id` (SERIAL)
- **Foreign Key**: `cpa_id` references `CPAs(cpa_id)`.
- **Columns**:
  - `client_id`: Auto-incremented unique identifier for each client.
  - `name` (VARCHAR(100)): The client's full name.
  - `address` (VARCHAR(255)): The client's address for correspondence.
  - `income` (DECIMAL(10,2)): The client's annual income.
  - `tax_materials_submitted` (BOOLEAN): Indicates whether the client has submitted their tax materials.
  - `cpa_id` (INT): The ID of the CPA assigned to the client.
- **Purpose**:
  - Represents clients of the accounting firm.
  - Links each client to a specific CPA for personalized tax preparation.

### 3. TaxFilingAssistants Table
- **Primary Key**: `assistant_id` (SERIAL)
- **Columns**:
  - `assistant_id`: Auto-incremented unique identifier for each assistant.
  - `name` (VARCHAR(100)): The name of the assistant.
- **Purpose**:
  - Stores information about tax filing assistants involved in the preparation process.

### 4. TaxReturns Table
- **Primary Key**: `return_id` (SERIAL)
- **Foreign Key**: `client_id` references `Clients(client_id)`.
- **Columns**:
  - `return_id`: Auto-incremented unique identifier for each tax return.
  - `client_id` (INT UNIQUE): Client associated with the tax return (one return per client).
  - `status` (BOOLEAN): Indicates whether the tax return has been filed.
  - `filing_timestamp` (TIMESTAMP): Records the date and time of filing.
  - `checked_by_cpa` (BOOLEAN): Indicates whether the tax return was reviewed by a CPA.
  - `filed_by_assistant` (BOOLEAN): Indicates whether the return was filed by an assistant.
- **Purpose**:
  - Tracks the progress and details of tax returns for each client.
  - Ensures compliance with the one-return-per-client rule via a UNIQUE constraint.

## Design Decisions

1. **Normalization**:
   - Each table is focused on a specific entity, reducing redundancy and improving clarity.

2. **Relationships**:
   - Foreign keys establish logical links between related entities, such as associating clients with CPAs and tax returns with clients.

3. **Constraints**:
   - The UNIQUE constraint on `client_id` in the `TaxReturns` table enforces a one-to-one relationship between clients and tax returns.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Auto-incremented primary keys allow seamless addition of new records without manual ID management.

5. **Data Integrity**:
   - Referential integrity is maintained through foreign keys, ensuring valid relationships between entities.

6. **Flexibility**:
   - The schema supports future expansion, such as adding new attributes or tables for additional features.
